Dr. Summa, if you are reading this, this means you have opened my README.txt file.

Hello,

I wanted to inform you that I do not have the JUnit tests for my Blackjack HW mainly
because I did not understand how your JUnit examples worked and how we were to
test our classes. I felt that we did not cover JUnit very well in lecture since we spent
three class periods going over Git. I was hoping that since this course and its homework
will have JUnit testing included, that you could possibly go over JUnit testing again.

Regards,
